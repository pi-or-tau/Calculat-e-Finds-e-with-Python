# "Calculat-e"
## Finds e with Python
This is a project that I am creating to allow python users to find e to whatever value they want (or dare).

This project will be updated and possibly given multi-core support with the Python "Multiprocessing" library.

Note: This project was performed and, if I remember correctly, the end result with a underpowered computer was a million digits of e, but it was not accurate, only because I set it to only repeat the process a ten times. This is due to it running on a underpowered computer.
